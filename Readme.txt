CryENGINE MOD SDK for Far Cry Ver. 1.4, Readme file - October 6, 2006

The CryENGINE MOD SDK for Far Cry is unsupported by Crytek and Ubisoft, and the usage 
of the CryENGINE MOD SDK for Far Cry is at your own risk. 
Help could be available at http://www.crymod.com.
Please investigate the user communities available through links at http://www.crymod.com.

The basic tools you need to make a MOD are the CryENGINE Sandbox Editor, 
scripts and model exporters.
Game scripts have been released in source format and Far Cry levels are 
available in source format as well, all on the original Far Cry DVD/CDROM.
The LuaCompiler.exe tool included in the bin32 folder is used by the editor to 
verify scripts for syntax errors during real-time editing, it is not supposed to 
be used as a standalone compiler to produce precompiled lua scripts.

Starting from this version, C++ Game source code has been released as well.
New incremental updates to the C++ modules may be released in the future on http://www.crymod.com.

Within the CryENGINE MOD SDK for Far Cry, you will find documentation, samples, 
exporters, plugins, source assets, c++ source code, and other useful things to learn 
how to create any kind of MOD or TC. Please read the basic Far Cry Mods Guide "FCMG.doc" in the 
docs folder and visit the official CryENGINE Modding Portal www.crymod.com.

In addition to Crytek exporters, the source code for both static and animated models format 
is included in the SDK; we encourage you to use it to write exporters/converters 
for your favourite free modeling/animation package.
The document "Using the Crytek Exporter plugin for 3DMax.pdf" contains a detailed 
description of Crytek's file format.
